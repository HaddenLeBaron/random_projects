Story1 = """Now we have devised robots that are much more complicated than any other machines we have ever had.
 They are complicated enough to do jobs that until now only human beings could do, but that are too simple for the 
 marvelous brains we all have. The robots, even though they are smarter than other machines, are still only capable 
 of very simple tasks - the kind of tasks human beings ought not to waste their time doing. In that case, why not let 
 the robots do it? Why shouldn't human beings do other and better things? After all, whenever there is an important new 
 invention, some jobs are lost. When the automobile came into use, there was a gradual, but steady, loss of jobs that
  involved horses. There were fewer stables, fewer manufacturers of buggies and wagons, fewer whips, and fewer spurs.
   On the other hand, think of the jobs the automobile created. Think of all the garages that came into being, all 
   the auto mechanics needed, all the tire manufacturing, highway building, oil well drilling. Automobiles created 
   hundreds of times as many jobs as they destroyed. That's the way it will be with robots too. Lots of assembly-line
    jobs will vanish but think of all the jobs needed to design robots, manufacture their parts, put them together,
     install them, and keep them in good repair. There will be many more jobs coming into being 
     than are being destroyed. The jobs that are destroyed will be very dull ones anyway, so dull that even a robot can do them.
      The jobs that will be created will be interesting ones that will stretch the mind. Of course, there is a catch. 
      We can't just tell a person who has been working on an assembly line for twenty-five years to stop and take a job 
      designing robots instead. It takes a special kind of education to be able to work with robots, and assembly-line 
      workers won't have it. If we are going to have a large changeover in types of jobs, there will have to be a careful
       programme of retraining and re-education for people with old-style jobs. It will have to be done even if 
       they take rather simple new-style ones. That will be expensive and hard, but it will have to be done.
        There are also sure to be people who are too old, or too beaten down by the dull job they had to do all their
         lives, to be able to take advantage of retraining. Some sorts of jobs will have to be found that they can do. 
         Eventually, of course, things will be different. Children going to schools in the future will be educated in 
         ways of using and understanding computers and robots. They will grow up and be able to take the new jobs, and 
         no one will ever consider the old jobs or want them. Everyone will be glad to leave the dull jobs and the 
         dangerous jobs too"""
Story2 = """At first the professor scowled with concern, but then he said, that's all right. Run to my house.
 Tell my wife to give you one of my shirts. Mrs. Smith quickly fetched one of her husband's white shirts,
  but when Phillip put it on, she began to exclaim, "Oh, dear! Gracious!"
   The shirt was so large that Phillip was almost lost in it. Hastily, Mrs. Smith found a box of pins.
    In a twinkling, her nimble fingers pinned enough into the shirt to make it fit Phillip. 
    They both heaved a big sigh of relief when the job was finished. Then, free from anxiety,
     Phillip hurried back to the school. The concert finally began, and soon it was time for Phillip's solo.
      He stood up, placed the violin under his chin, and raised his bow. With horror he felt a pin pulling loose
       in the back of his shirt, but he recalled how many pins had been inserted into the shirt and thought, 
       "Losing one won't matter". Phillip started to play. At first his right arm moved back and forth slowly,
        then more swiftly. Before long the pins that were holding his collar pulled out, 
        The large shirt collar began to creep up the back of Phillip's head, 
        then the unruly sleeves grew looser and longer. Suddenly, the shirt fell away from his neck. 
         The audience began to laugh. In embarrassed confusion, Phillip forgot what he was playing and stopped completely.
          The disaster so upset him that he rushed off the stage and sulked in a dark corner. Fighting back tears, 
          he mumbled gloomily, "I wish I were dead." Refreshments were served after the concert, but Phillip was too busy pouting
          to have any. He mingled with the crowd as quickly as he could, hoping to avoid Mr. Smith. 
          After a wistful look at the ice cream, Phillip was about to slink out when a booming voice behind him scoffed,
           "Well, Phillip, you made a nice mess of it." Phillip turned and found himself face to face with his glowering
            teacher. With no sympathy for poor Phillip, Mr. Smith continued unreasonably, "No refreshments for you!
             You shouldn't have spent the day playing ball. You should have been preparing for the important work of 
             the evening. You ought to be ashamed!" He hung his head, sighed heavily, and trudged home. The incident that night left
              such an impression on him that he never forgot. He never again tried to mix work and play."""
